NC-News (FRONTEND) - REACT WEBSITE

A website that gets data from https://jamie-backendapp.herokuapp.com/api to display Topics, Articles and Comments. It allows voting on comments that weren't created by the logged in user, and the ability to post and delete comments to articles. Articles can be arranged several ways and the website displays on both a monitor and a smaller phone display.

LOCAL USE

Install the required dependencies (axios, @reach/router)

```bash
npm install
```

SETTING UP THE WEBSITE FOR USE.

To start the website locally, just type the command "npm start" and it should automatically open your default browser to http://localhost:3000/ and display the Homepage.

```bash
npm start
```

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SITE

The site doesn't have a live login server but you can log in as any user by typing any password over 1 character long.
To test the full functionality log in as a user that has made articles and comments - tickle122, cooljmessy, weegembump, jessjelly or the user that is logged in as default grumpy19.
