REVIEW APP (FRONTEND) - REACT WEBSITE

A website that gets data from https://jamie-backendapp.herokuapp.com/api to display Topics, Articles and Comments. It allows voting on comments that weren't created by the logged in user, and the ability to post and delete comments to articles. Articles can be several ways and the website displays on both a monitor and a smaller phone display.
